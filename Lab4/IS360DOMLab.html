        <section>
            <h2 class="Head2">Research to focus on improved prediction of tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, snow</h2>

            <p>NOAA Administrator Kathryn Sullivan announced today $5.7 million in cooperative 
                research agreements and grants to improve the forecasting of hazardous and 
                extreme weather including tornadoes, hurricanes, heavy rainfall, floods and 
                snowstorms</p>

            <p>These research investments are designed to accelerate the development and 
                use of advanced observing systems, forecast models, and other decision-support 
                tools that will improve our nation’s resilience to hazardous weather, said Sullivan 
                during remarks at the Society of Environmental Journalists conference in Norman, Oklahoma</p>

            <h2 class="Head2">Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment in the Southeast U.S.</h2>

            <p>a new research program to improve tornado forecasts and warnings in the Southeastern United 
                States, building upon the best practices and knowledge gained from earlier projects 
                in the Great Plains. This new research program will advance our understanding of how 
                environmental factors in the region affect the formation, intensity, structure, and 
                path of tornadoes in this region. The research will also determine public perceptions 
                of tornado risk, the best methods for communicating forecast uncertainty to the public, 
                and differences in the way various demographic groups receive and respond to tornado 
                warnings. This work will not only help inform storm prediction in the southeast U.S., 
                but also in other regions such as the southern Great Plains and Texas.</p>

        <h1 class="Head">NOAA online map update offers improved coastal observations and forecasts</h1>
        <section>
            <h2 class="Head2">Additional data, animation features added to popular coastal product</h2>
            <p>NOAA has upgraded nowCOAST, a GIS-based online map service providing more frequently 
                updated ocean observations along with coastal and marine weather forecasts. The 
                new version, which went live on September 21, also offers a visual point-and-click 
                access to 60 NOAA data products and services. Users can reach the site at 
                nowcoast.noaa.gov.</p>

            <p>NOAA’s nowCOAST gives the public a one-stop-shop look at coastal conditions — 
                real-time and forecast — before they do or plan anything on the water, said 
                Rear Admiral Gerd Glang, director of NOAA’s Office of Coast Survey. 
                Are you sailing? Look at the winds and currents. Are you a commercial shipper? 
                Get your high seas marine weather forecast, on the same animated map where you 
                can check the tides before you approach your port.</p>

            <p>The original version of nowCOAST, available since 2003, has provided the public 
                with information on the latest observed and predicted coastal weather, marine 
                weather, and oceanographic and river conditions. The updated map viewer allows 
                users to animate observations for the past four hours and forecasts 
                for the next seven days.</p>
